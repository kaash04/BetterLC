# BetterLC - Unlock LeetCode Company Tags

**BetterLC** is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your experience on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) by unlocking and displaying company tags for coding problems, even if they're not natively visible. This helps users prepare more effectively for technical interviews by targeting problems asked by specific companies.

## Features

- **Unlock Company Tags:** Displays company tags for LeetCode problems directly on the problem page.
- **Floating Button UI:** A draggable, stylish floating button appears on LeetCode problem pages. Hovering over it reveals the associated company tags.
- **Popup Menu:** The extension popup provides quick links to support the developer, contribute to the project, or learn more about the author.
- **Minimal & Modern Design:** Uses a clean, modern UI with custom fonts and smooth transitions.
- **No User Data Collection:** The extension works entirely client-side and does not collect or transmit any user data.

---

## How It Works

- When you visit a LeetCode problem page, the extension injects a floating button.
- On hover, the button displays a tooltip listing all companies that have asked the current problem (based on a local dataset).
- The company tag data is sourced from a bundled `data.json` file, which maps LeetCode problem URLs to their respective company tags.
